Todo list for the Schr√∂dinger Functional implementation

* Coding

** General stuff [0/3]
- [ ] Gauge Fixing
- [ ] Zero Modes 
      It seems that this is not needed. In the original SF paper
      (LNWW92) it is stated in chapter 3.3 (one loop effective action)
      that there could be a finite number of zero modes, but that this
      is an unlikely case.
- [ ] Boundary conditions
      lattice.h is the starting point here
  * [ ] Find out which are the active links at the boundary
  * [ ] Decide if it is easiest to change the Vol variable and have
        the sums in the code automatically right or change the return
        value of the get() method to return a null pointer if the link
        is not active
    * The second option seems to be the easiest to implement and maybe
      also the cleanest, even though the if clauses could add some costs
    * One could also introduce a special kind of link that just does
      not change, but has the same methods, which are just void...

** Links (newQCDpt)[3/3]
