Scripts to run the code on different machines
=============================================

run.sh

A very naive script that writes the flow_ipt file and run
LocalQuenchFlow. Make sure you modify the script to accommodate for
the parmeters you require.

submit.py
=========

A more complex python script to run for a whole set of parameters.
