Discusion with Francesco, Stefan, Mattia in Dublin, March 6th, 2012

* Short-Term

** Coding
- openMPI (to get CPU time)
   - for Quenceched code
- New observable: \bar V (\nu -derivative)

** Analysis
- How does the noise scale with L?
- Autocorrelation?!
- Extrapolation in the step size.

** Simulations
- Confirmation of correctnes of Quenched code
   - run on L = 4, 6, 8, 12
   - compare with loop data for coupling
- Plaquette
   - in the bulk P(T/2)
   - at the boundary P(0), P(T)
   - compare to NP data at high beta
- New observable: \bar V (\nu -derivative)
- Running coupling Quenched for L = T +/- a
   - change c_t at tree level
   - can compute c_t at one loop, two loop?


** Speculations
- Three loop cut-off effects of \bar g...

* Mid-Term

** Coding
- Fermions
- SU(2)
- Other representations of the gauge group.
  - Only changes coupling of the gluons to the fermions, not the gauge
    action.

** Socializing
- connect to Regensburg/Wuppertal people
