Running small scale simulations
*******************************

We have the file run.sh, which will strart 12 runs for various values
of tau and s. What you have to do is the following

1) untar the file
 Which you have probably already done if you can read this :)

2) modify
 Quench.cfg
   you need to replace 
    - the temporal lattice extend by "TALLOC"
    - the parameter s by "SPAR"
    - the parameter tau by "TAU"
 damocle.dag
   you need to replace 
    - the parameter tau by "TAU"

 you should also set BEAT and SWEEP
 after BEAT updates of the gauge config, a measurement is performed
 we perform SWEEP measurements in total

3) go to ~/work and call

atnsub -n generic --nnodes=1 --walltime=TIME -s ~/parmalgt-0.11/run.sh

4) the data is rsynced to DATADIR, which is set in run.sh, we write
  - Plaquettes: st_plaq, ss_plaq, bd_plaq (c.f. Milc code or notes for
    details)
  - Couplings: v (actually \bar v), Gamma' (as in Stefan's paper).

  The data is in binary, if you call
  od -t f8 Gp.bindat,
  you get an output like this:
                     REAL                     IMAGINARY
